- Merge organizing/management skill and rate into one "efficacy" parameter: x
  skill = x
  contact rate = round( skill * firm_size )
- Visualize: union x and management x vs share of elections won
    - Time between elections
    - Find x_u and x_m that minimizes distance between real data and simulation data
